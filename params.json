{"name":"Engl508","tagline":"University of Victoria","body":"# Week 1 | 4 January | Interpretation through Alteration\r\n\r\nWhy interpret texts by altering them?

When do images resist translation into text? How are screens and pages entangled in interpretation? \r\n\r\nWorkshop: Intro to metadata (including Dublin Core) \r\n\r\nRead: Selections from Drucker, [*Figuring the Word*](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/druckerFiguringTheWord.pdf) |  Mitchell, [\"What Do Pictures 'Really' Want?\"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/mitchellWhatPictures.pdf) \r\n\r\nNotebook: Digitize or acquire your text as a series of page images (TIFF, JPG, PNG). Interpret the text as an image on a screen. \r\n\r\n# Week 5 | 1 February | Make It Metadata. \r\n\r\nWhen is text merely description? What does text about text do?

Print + Assemble It.\r\n\r\nWhat is the relation between print and digital typography? How do we think about them together? How does typography invite readers? \r\n\r\nWorkshop: Making forms \r\n\r\nRead: Selections from Bringhurst, [*The Elements of Typographic Style*](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/bringhurstElements.pdf) | See also, Lupton, [*Thinking with Type*](http://thinkingwithtype.com/)\r\n\r\nNotebook: Change the typeface of your text, print it, and assemble it as a booklet. Interpret the text as type.  \r\n\r\n# Week 9 | 29 February | Make It a Form. \r\n\r\nWhen and why do texts become documents? How do they gather and store information?

With the portfolio, include a brief cover letter describing the effects of your various alterations. Please note: a cover letter is not a seminar paper or journal article. For the purposes of this seminar, it should describe, reflect, and project, not analyze, deconstruct, or interrogate.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
