<p><em>Questioning the face value of texts. Prototyping what else they could be.</em></p>
          <h2>
<a id="week1"></a>Week 1 | 5 January | What's a Prototype? What's Text?</h2>

<p>Why interpret texts by altering them? What are some low-tech approaches to prototyping and interpreting texts in a whiz-bang world? How do we think about design and text together?</p>

<h2><a id="week2"></a>Week 2 | 12 January | Survey Some -Isms.</h2>

<p>Between the 1870s and 1970s, what are some notable -isms operating across art, culture, and textual production? How were these -isms designed? How do their aesthetics and politics intertwine?</p>

<p>Workshop: Sharing digital files for this seminar (FTP, GitHub, Drive, and Tumblr) </p>

<p>Read: Caws, <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/cawsManifesto.pdf">"The Poetics of the Manifesto"</a> | Chan, <a href="http://eltiffster.github.io/ActNatural/" target="_blank">"Act Natural"</a> | Matheson, <a href="https://508prototypepage.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">"Ouliprototype"</a> | Murphy, <a href="http://www.itisnotthesea.com/" target="_blank">"Prototyping Personism"</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalmanifesto.net/manifestos/">Digital Manifesto Archive</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://modjourn.org/">Modernist Journals Project</a> </p>

<p>Notebook: Take notes on your general impressions of at least five -isms. Please attend to the politics and aesthetics of each -ism, with notes on the historical particulars of when each occurred and why.</p>

<h2><a id="week3"></a>Week 3 | 19 January | Pick an -Ism.</h2>

<p>What's your -ism?</p>

<p>Workshop: In-class presentations (five minutes each, plus Q&amp;A)</p>

<p>Notebook: Select an -ism you wish to study throughout the term as well as a key text (poem, manifesto, fiction) representing that -ism. Ideally, this text will have significant or notable design elements. Thoroughly describe the aesthetic (style, composition, materials), political (ideologies, representations, biases), and cultural (community, modes of expression) contexts of your text.</p>

<h2><a id="week4"></a>Week 4 | 26 January | Make It an Image.</h2>

<p>When is text also image? And image also text? When do images resist translation into text? How are screens and pages entangled in interpretation? How do images address us?</p>

<p>Workshop: Intro to metadata (including Dublin Core)</p>

<p>Read: Selections from Drucker, <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/druckerFiguringTheWord.pdf"><em>Figuring the Word</em></a> | Paglen, <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/invisible-images-your-pictures-are-looking-at-you/" target="_blank">"Invisible Images (Your Pictures Are Looking at You)"</a> | <a href="https://archive.org/index.php" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> | <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/pubfig/" target="_blank">Public Figures Face Database</a></p>

<p>Notebook: Digitize or acquire your text as a series of page images (TIFF, JPG, PNG). Put it in a context of use. Interpret it as an image.</p>

<h2><a id="week5"></a>Week 5 | 2 February | Make It Metadata.</h2>

<p>When is text merely description? When is it infrastructure? What does text about text do? What does metadata do beyond keeping things found?</p>

<p>Workshop: Converting text to ASCII and composing with HTML5</p>

<p>Read: Schnapp, <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/schnappSmallData.pdf">"Small Data: The Intimate Lives of Cultural Objects"</a> | <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a></p>

<p>Notebook: Articulate ten metadata fields for your text and provide data for each field. Put it in a context of use. Interpret the text as metadata.</p>

<h2><a id="week6"></a>Week 6 | 9 February | Make It ASCII. Make It Markup.</h2>

<p>What does plain text do? How is it processed? How does it get hyper?</p>

<p>Workshop: Considering typefaces and fonts</p>

<p>Read: Nelson, <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/nelsonDream.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Computer Lib / Dream Machines</em></a> | Danet, <a href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/danetAscii.pdf" target="_blank">"ASCII Art and Its Antecedents"</a> | <a href="http://goldsen.library.cornell.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art</a> | <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tools" target="_blank">Voyant</a></p>

<p>Notebook: Generate an ASCII (or plain text) version of your text, removing all formatting. Put it in a context of use. Interpret it as plain text. Then encode your text in HTML5. Put it in another context of use. Interpret it as markup.</p>

<h2><a id="week7"></a>Week 7 | 16 February | Make Nothing.</h2>

<p>No seminar. Take a break.</p>

<h2><a id="week8"></a>Week 8 | 23 February | Make It a Booklet. Change the Typeface. Print and Assemble It.</h2>

<p>What is the relation between print and digital typography? Tactile and screen media? How do we think about them together? How does typography invite or exclude readers?</p>

<p>Workshop: Making forms</p>

<p>Read: Bringhurst, selections from <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/bringhurstElements.pdf"><em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em></a> | Lupton, <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkingwithtype.com/"><em>Thinking with Type</em></a></p>

<h2><a id="week9"></a>Week 9 | 2 March | Make It a Form.</h2>

<p>When and why do texts become documents? How do they gather and store information? How do they exhibit traces of use?</p>

<p>Workshop: Bots and databending</p>

<p>Read: Gitelman, <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/gitelmanShortHistory.pdf">"A Short History of _____"</a> | <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/Pages/politics-government.aspx" target="_blank">Library and Archives Canada: Politics and Government</a></p>

<p>Notebook: Convert your text into a fillable form. Put it in a context of use. Have at least three other people complete it. Interpret the text as a document.</p>

<h2><a id="week10"></a>Week 10 | 9 March | Make It Indeterminate. Redact It. Glitch It. Automate It.</h2>

<p>How are texts what's missing? When and how do they break? How might their materiality surprise us? What happens if we accelerate their aging or compression?</p>

<p>Workshop: Recording sound and sonifying texts</p>

<p>Read: Craze, <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/crazeDeadLetter.pdf">"In the Dead Letter Office"</a> | Menkman, <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/menkmanVernacular.pdf">"Vernacular of File Formats"</a> | Belojevic, <a href="https://ninabelojevic.wordpress.com/portfolio/nintendo-circuit-bending/" target="_blank">"Circuit Bending"</a> | Pipkin and Schmidt, <a href="http://withering.systems/" target="_blank">withering.systems</a> | Parrish, <a href="https://twitter.com/the_ephemerides?lang=en" target="_blank">The Ephemerides</a> | Kazemi, <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora" target="_blank">Corpora</a> | Parrish, <a href="https://github.com/aparrish/pycorpora" target="_blank">PyCorpora</a> | Compton, <a href="https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery" target="_blank">Tracery</a></p>

<p>Notebook: Hide, mask, or erase aspects of your text. Put it in a context of use. Interpret it as a redaction. Now repeatedly compress and bend your text. Put it in another context of use. Interpret it as a glitch. If you wish, then feel free to turn your text into a bot, too.</p>

<h2><a id="week11"></a>Week 11 | 16 March | Make It Sound.</h2>

<p>How are texts heard? Performed? How do they speak? Through which formats?</p>

<p>Workshop: Presenting your work</p>

<h2><a id="week12"></a>Week 12 | 23 March | Make It ______.</h2>

<p>It's your turn. Cook up your own exercise. Run an experiment. Put the resulting text in a context of use. Interpret the effects. Present them during seminar. Looking forward to hearing your ideas and seeing your prototypes!</p>

<h2><a id="week13"></a>Week 13 | 30 March | Make It a Presentation.</h2>

<p>We'll conduct public presentations during this seminar meeting.</p>

<h2><a id="week16"></a>Weeks 14-16 | Portfolio</h2>

<p>Please compile all of your digital and tactile materials into a portfolio using an approach of your choice. With the portfolio, include a brief cover statement describing the effects of your various alterations. Please note: a cover statement is not a seminar paper or journal article. For the purposes of this seminar, it should describe, reflect, and project, not analyze, deconstruct, or interrogate. </p>
