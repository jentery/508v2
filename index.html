<p><em>Questioning the face value of texts. Prototyping what else they could be.</em></p>
          <h2>
<a id="week1"></a>Week 1 | 4 January | Interpretation through Alteration</h2>

<p>Why interpret texts by altering them? What are some low-tech approaches to prototyping and interpreting texts in a whiz-bang world? How do we think about design and fiction together? </p>

<h2>
<a id="week2"></a>Week 2 | 11 January | Survey Some -Isms.</h2>

<p>Between the 1870s and 1970s, what are some notable -isms operating across art, culture, and politics? How were these -isms designed? </p>

Thoroughly describe the aesthetic (style, composition, materials), political (ideologies, representations, biases), and cultural (community, modes of expression) contexts of your text.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="week4"></a>Week 4 | 25 January | Image It.</h2>

<h2>
<a id="week5"></a>Week 5 | 1 February | Make It Metadata.</h2>

<p>When is text merely description? What does text about text do? What does metadata do beyond keeping things found?</p>

<p>Workshop: On ASCII and plain text; also, composing with HTML5</p>

<h2>
<a id="week8"></a>Week 8 | 22 February | Change the Typeface. Print + Assemble It.</h2>

<h2>
<a id="week9"></a>Week 9 | 29 February | Make It a Form.</h2>

<p>When and why do texts become documents? How do they gather and store information? How do they exhibit traces of use? </p>

<h2>
<a id="week11"></a>Week 11 | 14 March | Redact It. Glitch It.</h2>

With the portfolio, include a brief cover letter describing the effects of your various alterations. Please note: a cover letter is not a seminar paper or journal article.
